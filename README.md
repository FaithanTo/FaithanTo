## About Me
Hi, I'm Faithan - pronounced like "Nathan with an F"!
- Caffeinated supply chain analyst and MS in Business Analytics candidate who bridges business strategy with applied machine learning (LSTM, NLP, etc...).
- Whether itâ€™s forecasting demand, streamlining ERP systems, or designing dashboards, I focus on delivering operational impact.
- Currently wrapping up my time at Minnesota Carlson where I've used Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Jira to build practical, project-based analytics solutions across supply chain use cases.
